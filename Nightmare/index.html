                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Nightmare is a 2D horde survival action-adventure game developed for PC, where players assume the role of a child trapped in an ever-darkening dream world. As the dream progresses, the player must battle waves of increasingly grotesque monsters and demons, transitioning from seemingly harmless, cuddly toys to terrifying creatures. Developed by a team of six university students over a three-month period, the game seamlessly blends atmospheric storytelling, dynamic combat, and engaging progression mechanics.

                <h3>Gameplay & Mechanics:</h3>
                <p>
                    Players can unlock and upgrade up to 10 distinct weapons throughout the game, each with unique abilities. Upgrades are powered by premium currency earned through gameplay, and each weapon offers its own distinct improvement path. For instance, upgrading the Marshmallow Mace adds a second mace, enhancing the player’s damage output.
                </p>
                <h3>Art Style:</h3>
                <p>
                    The game utilizes a 32x32 pixel art style, embracing a cartoon-like aesthetic that balances nostalgia with an eerie, surreal atmosphere. This minimalist style effectively conveys both the whimsical and increasingly sinister aspects of the dream world, enhancing the player’s immersion as the environment shifts from playful to nightmarish.
