                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Bleach Tapper is an idle game developed as part of a university rapid game design module, requiring the creation of a new game each week over a 5-week period, each based on a different theme. This game follows a cookie clicker style, where players repeatedly tap to defeat enemies and collect souls, which can be used to level up their character and enhance abilities. The project showcases engaging gameplay mechanics within a simple yet addictive format.

                <h3>Gameplay & Mechanics:</h3>
                <p>
                    Bleach Tapper offers an engaging and addictive gameplay experience centered around the classic cookie-clicker format. Players defeat enemies by tapping on the screen, which triggers a combat sequence and allows them to collect souls as a reward for their efforts. These souls serve as the primary currency for progression within the game. As players accumulate souls, they can invest them into leveling up their character and enhancing various abilities, creating a satisfying feedback loop that encourages continual gameplay. The design features a balanced progression system, ensuring that each upgrade feels meaningful while maintaining a steady challenge. This mechanic not only keeps players engaged but also motivates them to strategize on how best to allocate their collected souls to optimize their character’s performance and abilities, ultimately fostering a sense of achievement and progression throughout the idle gaming experience.

        <h3>Character Design:</h3>

        <p>
            The game features three playable characters, each with unique attributes that enhance the gameplay experience. The first character, Ichigo, serves as the default choice for players at the beginning of the game. Upon collecting 50 souls, players can unlock Chad, adding a new dimension to their combat strategy. Further progression allows players to acquire Orihime after reaching 100 souls, providing additional support in the fight against hollows and soul reapers. Players can also level up each character using the souls earned from defeating enemies, allowing for customized gameplay and strategic enhancements as they progress through the game.
