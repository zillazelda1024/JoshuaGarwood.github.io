                <p>
                    Where Am I? is a challenging puzzle game where players must solve progressively complex challenges to find their way out of a mysterious environment. Developed over three months as a solo university project, the game is designed to test players' problem-solving abilities with increasingly difficult puzzles. The project utilized pre-approved assets for the game's textures, allowing for a strong focus on gameplay mechanics and level design.

                <p>
                    The core gameplay of Where Am I centers around increasingly complex puzzles that challenge players' critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As players progress through the game, new mechanics are introduced gradually, maintaining a balanced difficulty curve that keeps them engaged without becoming overly frustrating. Each level is meticulously designed to complement the puzzle mechanics, with clear visual and spatial elements that guide players through the environment. The game features an intuitive, unobtrusive user interface, allowing players to focus entirely on the puzzles and their surroundings. While external assets were used for textures, they were carefully integrated to match the game’s aesthetic, creating a cohesive experience that enhances both the gameplay and the atmospheric puzzle-solving environment.
