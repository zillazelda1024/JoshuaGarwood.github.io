                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The Letter Temple is a fast-paced game developed as part of a university rapid game design module, where a new game had to be created each week based on a different theme. This project focused on the theme of "weird input." Players must quickly tap the key that appears on screen for a limited time—only two seconds. If they miss or press the wrong key, they incur damage. The ultimate goal is to navigate through the dungeon and reach the end.

                <h3>Gameplay & Mechanics:</h3>
                <p>
                    In The Letter Temple, players engage in a fast-paced, reflex-driven gameplay experience centered around rapid key tapping. The core mechanic involves a dynamic input challenge where keys randomly appear on the screen for only two seconds, requiring players to react swiftly. If they fail to press the correct key within the time limit or mistakenly hit the wrong one, they incur damage, heightening the stakes and urgency. As players progress through the dungeon, they encounter increasingly complex sequences that test their reaction times and adaptability. The game is designed to foster improvement, encouraging players to refine their skills with each level while striving to reach the dungeon's end. This blend of quick reflexes and strategic input management creates a compelling and engaging gameplay loop.

        <h3>Guardians Design:</h3>

        <p>
            The game features five distinct guardians, each presenting an escalating challenge as players advance through the levels. With each new guardian, players encounter increased health and damage output, intensifying the difficulty of the encounters. This progression not only enhances the overall challenge but also adds a layer of strategic depth, as players must adapt their tactics to overcome the more formidable adversaries. As players progress, the heightened stakes and increased punishing consequences for mistakes ensure a compelling and engaging gameplay experience.
