        <h3>Monster Designs:</h3>

        <p>
            I developed a series of monster target designs that are intended to emerge from various hiding spots, such as behind cover or around corners, with the goal of creating jump-scare moments for players. Each target is assigned a distinct point value based on its difficulty and visibility, encouraging players to prioritize their shots strategically. This design approach not only enhances the gameplay experience but also adds an element of excitement as players aim to maximize their scores by hitting higher-value targets.
