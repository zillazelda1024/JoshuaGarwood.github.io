      <h3>PCG Dungeon Generator (2024)</h3>
      <p class="project-subtitle">University Dissertation Artifact</p>

      <p class="project-description">
       Platform: PC
Team Size: 1
Project Duration: 5 months
Engine & Tools: Unity, Photoshop, YouTube

Project Overview:

For my university dissertation, I developed a PC-based artifact focused on procedural content generation (PCG) methods for dungeon generation. This project explored various PCG algorithms commonly applied in dungeon generation, analyzing their strengths and limitations. The artifact is an interactive application that demonstrates each algorithm's capabilities by allowing users to adjust map parameters, such as dungeon size, number of rooms, and corridor configurations. This adjustable functionality offers insight into the flexibility and constraints of each algorithm.

Key Responsibilities & Contributions:

Complete Project Development

As the sole developer, I was responsible for the entire lifecycle of the project, from research and planning to execution. This included conducting in-depth research on established PCG algorithms, understanding their mechanics, and implementing these algorithms within the Unity framework to create a functional and informative artifact.

Algorithm Integration: Researched and integrated multiple PCG algorithms, implementing each to demonstrate their unique approaches to dungeon generation.

User Interface Design: Designed and implemented a minimalistic, grey-boxed UI layout using Unity's default assets, prioritizing functionality over aesthetics to focus attention on the algorithms' output.

Project Demonstration: Developed a flexible, parameter-driven system that enables users to dynamically adjust dungeon generation characteristics. This system allows for hands-on exploration of how different algorithms handle changes in dungeon size, room count, and corridor layout.

Project Duration: 3 months
Engine & Tools: Unity, Photoshop, Google Docs, YouTube

Project Overview:
Nightmare is a PC-based action-adventure game where players take on the role of a child navigating a dark and progressively sinister dream world. The player must battle various monsters and demons as the dream deepens into a nightmare. Developed over the course of three months by a team of six university students, Nightmare combines atmospheric storytelling, dynamic combat, and immersive visual design.

Key Responsibilities & Contributions:

Team Leadership & Project Management:
Led a multidisciplinary team of five other students, managing timelines, task allocation, and ensuring effective communication across all development phases. Coordinated all aspects of the project to ensure successful delivery within the set timeframe.

Gameplay Systems Development:
Designed and implemented the game's core health and damage systems for both enemies and weapons. Developed weapon upgrade mechanics, determining how each upgrade affects gameplay performance, and balanced these mechanics to enhance player experience.

Art & Asset Creation:
Created visual assets for both enemies and weapons, contributing to the game's distinct dark and eerie aesthetic. Designed the art to complement the evolving tone of the dream world, with increasingly menacing visuals as the game progresses.

UI/UX Design:
Developed and implemented the game's user interface, focusing on intuitive design and smooth player interaction. This included designing HUD elements and menus to align with the overall theme and ensure seamless navigation.

Scripting & Coding:
Authored key gameplay scripts, including enemy behaviors, weapon functionalities, and player interactions. Ensured that the technical aspects of the game aligned with both creative and gameplay goals.
