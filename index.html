      <h3>PCG Dungeon Generator (2024)</h3>
      <p class="project-subtitle">University Dissertation Artifact</p>

      <p class="project-description">
       Platform: PC
Team Size: 1
Project Duration: 5 months
Engine & Tools: Unity, Photoshop, YouTube

Project Overview:

For my university dissertation, I developed a PC-based artifact focused on procedural content generation (PCG) methods for dungeon generation. This project explored various PCG algorithms commonly applied in dungeon generation, analyzing their strengths and limitations. The artifact is an interactive application that demonstrates each algorithm's capabilities by allowing users to adjust map parameters, such as dungeon size, number of rooms, and corridor configurations. This adjustable functionality offers insight into the flexibility and constraints of each algorithm.
