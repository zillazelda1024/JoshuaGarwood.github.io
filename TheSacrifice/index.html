                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Sacrifice is a dark-themed game developed as part of a university rapid game design module, where a new game had to be created each week for 5 weeks, each based on a different theme. The theme for this project was "sacrifice." In the game, players choose what to sacrifice and then collect blood to summon a demon, with the ultimate goal of summoning Satan. Developed over the course of one week, the game features custom 2D art and engaging mechanics centered around ritualistic gameplay.

                <h3>Gameplay & Mechanics:</h3>
                <p>
                    In Sacrifice, players engage in a dark-themed experience where they must strategically choose what to sacrifice in order to collect blood and summon increasingly powerful demons, ultimately leading to the summoning of Satan. The gameplay mechanics are designed to be intuitive yet deeply engaging, allowing players to navigate through a series of ritualistic challenges. Players make critical decisions regarding their sacrifices, each of which has unique effects that influence gameplay and resource collection. This system adds layers of strategy and depth, encouraging players to experiment with different choices for optimal outcomes. The game’s levels are structured around the sacrificial theme, with resource management and decision-making at the forefront, creating a compelling and immersive experience that resonates with the overarching narrative.

                <p>
                    A total of six demons, along with Satan, can be summoned throughout the game. The type of demon summoned is determined by the specific blood collected, with players having the ability to mix and match different blood types to achieve various results. This system introduces strategic elements, encouraging players to experiment with their choices to discover the unique combinations that lead to the summoning of each demon.

        <h3>TThe Sacraifices:</h3>

        <p>
            Informed by the traditional elements of stereotypical sacrifice rituals, I decided to incorporate a human figure, a goat, and a duck as the sacrificial offerings in the game. This choice adds depth to the thematic elements, enhancing the ritualistic atmosphere and providing players with distinct options for their sacrifices.
