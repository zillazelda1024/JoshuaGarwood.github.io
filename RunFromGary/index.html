                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Run From Gary is a first-person horror game developed as part of a university rapid game design module, where a new game had to be created each week over a 5-week period. This particular project was centered around the theme of camera work. In the game, the player views the world through the lens of a handheld camera, recording their escape from a terrifying character named Gary. The game leverages unique camera mechanics to create an immersive, found-footage experience.

                <h3>Gameplay & Mechanics:</h3>
                <p>
                    Run From Gary immerses players in a first-person horror experience where they navigate a chilling environment through the lens of a handheld camera. The core gameplay revolves around evading a menacing character named Gary, with the camera mechanics enhancing the tension and urgency of the escape. Players must manage their limited visibility while recording their surroundings, leading to a found-footage aesthetic that amplifies the sense of dread. The camera simulates real-time movements, shakes, and zooms, creating a dynamic and unsettling atmosphere. Additionally, Gary's AI is programmed to actively pursue the player, intensifying the chase and prompting strategic maneuvers to avoid capture. The combination of suspenseful environmental design and innovative camera mechanics ensures a captivating and immersive gameplay experience.

                <h3>Enemy Design:</h3>

                <p>
                    Gary serves as the primary antagonist in Run From Gary, relentlessly pursuing the player through the forest. For his character design, I utilized a model obtained from Mixamo, incorporating a dynamic running animation from the same platform to enhance his menacing presence. This combination ensures that Gary's movements are both fluid and realistic, contributing significantly to the overall tension and horror experience of the game.

            <p>
                The puzzles in Where Am I gradually increase in complexity, evolving from simple tasks such as placing a cube on a pressure pad to solving intricate, multi-step challenges required to escape a single room. Each puzzle is carefully designed to engage players, encouraging them to think critically about their next move and strategically plan their actions to progress through the game.
